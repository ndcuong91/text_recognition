# text_recognition
text detector, text classifier ... collection. Just for research only

**Let check my [viText](https://github.com/ndcuong91/viText) to work more with Vietnamese text recognition!**
# Datasets
**SynthText** is a synthetically generated dataset and usually
used for pre-training the text detection models. This dataset
consists of 800,000 images with 8 million synthetic word instances with both word- and character-level annotations in the
form of rotated rectangles.

**ICDAR2013** is a typical horizontal text dataset and is proposed in Challenge 2 of the ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading
Competition. It contains 229 training images and 233 test images. ICDAR 2013 also provides both character- and wordlevel annotations.

**ICDAR2015** is a multi-orient text dataset and is proposed
in Challenge 4 of the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition. It focuses on incidental scene text and contains 1000
training images and 500 test images. This dataset only provides word-level annotations labeled with quadrangles.

**Total-Text** is a comprehensive arbitrary shape text dataset
for scene text reading. Total-Text contains 1255 training images and 300 test images. All images are annotated with polygons in word-level.

**CTW-1500** also focuses on arbitrary shape text reading
and contains 1000 training images and 500 test images. Different from Total-Text, the annotations in CTW-1500 are labeled with polygons in the text-line-level.
